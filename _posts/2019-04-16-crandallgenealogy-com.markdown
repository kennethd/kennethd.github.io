## Crandall Genealogy

***Welcome*** to the largest genealogy site on the internet of Crandalls, Crandells,
Crandles, Crandolls, Crundalls, etc., and descendants of Elder John Crandall.

The largest number known descendants are from Elder John CRANDALL line. It is
vast and includes many notable figures. This is massive undertaking that
continues with frequent updates and additions. The basis for the start of this
project would not have been possible without all the hard work of so many other
Elder John descendants. Included are the first twelve generations of Elder John
Crandall descendants. This is by no means a complete record of all descendants
as work continues identifying additional lines and individuals. As new data and
research reveals additional descendants, they are added. For security and
privacy reasons, later generations are limited. Every effort is made to ensure
the accuracy of the data presented here.

The 12 generations contained in this work has over 25,000 descendants of Elder
John and over 47,000 total individuals.

A complete copy of this site in PDF format is available - **Descendants of Elder John Crandall**
Current version 3.0. (2008) and about 22mg and is for personal use only.

The book [Elder John Crandall of Rhode Island and his Descendants](/genealogy/crandall/2019/04/20/elder-john-crandall),
by John Cortland Crandall, New Woodstock, New York, 1949 has been added for reference.

To locate those included in JCC's work on this site: 
Do a search on the the JCC number (JCC #----; example JCC #1234) for that
individual or their parent or, check name index to see if they have been
included in index. Not all individuals have been added or have links to them.
Work continues on the index as time permits. The first 6 generations have been
completed. Generation 7-11 have many added, but are not yet complete.

NOTE: Please remember while *Elder John Crandall of Rhode Island and his
Descendants* is a great starting place for Crandall researchers, there are
many errors contained within this work. These errors are, but not limited to
spelling, typo, omissions and lineage errors.  Please remember to verify all
information with other sources.

This information on this site is compiled from those earlier works as well as
additional research using sources such as biographies, burial records, census
records, newspapers and other archival material. This work is by no means a
complete record of descendants or ancestors. The site tries to include as many
references as available for those individuals contained within this work, with
attention source material such as burial, census records, biographies and
newspapers obits. Work continues on adding reference material as time permits.
Information and documentation Elder John has been omitted as I have no new
research on his ancestral roots and it is not the purpose of this site to
duplicate or take credit for the exceptional work of JCC or C.F.A. research on
him. I would like to make a personal note of Earl P. CRANDALL, CFA #1 for all
the hard work and time that he put into the Crandall Family Genealogy. Please
see C.F.A. works for information on him.

### First Generation

#### 1. John Crandall
Colonial pioneer, First Baptist Elder, Deputy Commissioner, and statesman of
Newport and Westerly, Rhode Island, the head of the Crandall family in America,
was born in Monmouthshire, England, on the line between England and Wales in 1612.
His mother is supposed to have been a Scotch lady.  He came to Boston within a
very few years after the landing of the Pilgrims, in 1634.  Several writers
have ascertained that he was associated with the Congregational Church at
Salem as 1635 and that "he was certainly living in Providence as early as
1637" and while there are many reasons for believing these statements correct
and that John Crandall was a close associate of **Roger Williams** was one of the
founders of Providence, unfortunately it seems impossible certainly to confirm
them.  Many of the original Providence records were early destroyed.

The first valid documentary account of John Crandall in New England shows him
to have been actively identified with the Baptist Church in Newport, July 21, 1651.
His name next is found, with that of **Matthew West** in the Freemen's list
of Newport, 1655.

John Crandall was the first Baptist Elder at Westerly, "Elder Crandall was well
calculated both by talent and sufferings to lead his people in their devotions.
He took an active part In the border difficulties between Massachusetts and
Connecticut and subsequently between Connecticut and Rhode Island, concerning
the lines between the states."

"With other founders of Westerly Mr. Crandall settled on the Misquamicutt land
before 1665. He was commissioner for a number of years, served as deputy from
both Newport and Westerly, and in other capacities which evidence that he was a
man of importance. Through the seven sons of Elder Crandall the name became a
common one and the family numerous in Rhode Island." (From *Representative men
and old families of Rhode Island*.)

Through the marriage of Elder John Crandall's sons and daughters, the family
became allied with other important pioneer families who were prominent in the
early history of Rhode Island, and New England. Among these were the **Gorton**,
**Babcock**, **Burdick**, **Hubbard**, and **Witter** families.

The name or origin of his first wife is not known, but it is recorded that she
died in 1670 and was buried August 2 of that year in Westerly. From examination
of the birth and marriage records of their children, and the dates at which
sons were listed as freemen, it may be inferred that John Crandall was first
married about the year 1649. He married, second, **Hannah Gaylord**.

Elder John Crandall died before November 29, 1676 at Newport where he was
sojourning on account of the Indian War (King Philip's War).

The *Journal of American History* gives the following sketch of the life of
Elder John Crandall, which is substantially correct with the probable exception
of the account of his activities prior to 1651:

    As early as 1635 Rev. John Crandall, who is believed to have been of Welsh
    ancestry, was living in Salem where, as elsewhere in the Massachusetts Bay
    Colony, there was at this time much opposition to all dissenters from the
    authorized tenets of the Puritans. John Crandall was the minister of the
    Salem church, but he adopted the opinions of the Baptists, which were very
    obnoxious to the Congregationalists, and in the autumn of 1635 he was
    dismissed as pastor. As did so many others of the early Baptists of New
    England he determined to settle in the Narragansett country. The Indians
    proved friendly and he obtained from them a grant of land. He has been
    called one of the founders of Providence. He was certainly living in
    Providence as early as 1637.

In 1669 he appears in "a list of the Free Inhabitants of the Town of Westerle"
May the 18, (John Crandall's name headed the list). Directly after this he,
with **Tobias Saunders**, was authorized by the colony to summon juries and hold
corts, they being appointed "Conservators or His Majesty's Peace."

John Crandall was one of the original purchasers from **Chief Sosoa** of
Narragansett of the Misquamicutt tribe, of the land comprising Westerly, from
which Hopkinton was later formed. The townships of Westerly, Hopkinton,
Charleston and Richmond, as they now are, were a tract called by the Indians
Misquamicutt and on August 27, 1661 John Crandall was one of the nine signers
of a petition to the Court of Commissioners for the Colony of Providence
Plantations, in session at Portsmouth, for the purchase of that part of the
tract which became Westerly. His house was near Burdens Pond and a part of it
now stands, as one room in the homestead occupied by lineal descendants, of the
ninth and tenth generations. Across from the house in the old orchard field is
the original cemetery, in which twenty seven bodies are buried. There are three
rows of graves containing nine bodies each. These rows of graves run parallel
with a swamp near by. Elder John is buried in the row nearest the swamp in the
end grave to the left as one stands facing the swamp. Next to his grave is that
of his son John. Each of the twenty seven graves is indicated by a field stone
some 14 inches in width, appearing four to eight inches above the ground set at
the head while a smaller stone marks the foot of the grave. There is no
inscription on any of the stones. On the 6th day of October 1932 A. Julian
Crandall of Ashaway, Rhode Island and Rev. Wm. S. Crandall of Binghamton, New
York, standing in the little historical burying ground, agreed that a suitable
marker should be placed thereupon. They further concluded that a large native
field granite boulder with a bronze plaque properly lettered, embedded in the
same would be most suitable. The two third cousins resolved that they would
sponsor the project. He was the first Baptist Elder at Westerly and held a
number of public offices at various times. In 1658, 1659, 1662, 1663 he was a
Commissioner, and was a Deputy to the General Court in 1667, 1670 and 1671,
representing Westerly during the two latter terms.

He had lived prior to his settlement at Westerly, at Newport.

There was much dispute between the colonies of Massachusetts and Connecticut as
to their jurisdictions, and especially as to jurisdiction over grants in Rhode
Island, which however, had been confirmed by a royal charter to their
purchasers. A claim was made in 1662 by Connecticut of land reaching beyond
Misquamicutt to Narragansett Bay. On October 17, 1667, a letter was sent by the
Connecticut authorities, to those of Rhode Island complaining that John
Crandall had taken possession of about a square mile of land, which he had laid
out to his sort, on the west side of the Pawcatuck River. On May 14, 1669 he
and Joseph Torrey were appointed commissioners for the purpose of conferring
with the Connecticut authorities concerning these land disputes. Certain
individuals lent thirty five shillings to the Colony of Rhode Island in order
to pay the expenses of Mr. Crandall to Connecticut. A few months later, on
November 18, the governor and assistants of Connecticut sent a letter
complaining that John Crandall and some others had appropriated a large tract
of land in the township of Stonington, Connecticut. A reply to this complaint
was sent by the Town of Westerly on March 11, 1669, signed by John Crandall and
Tobias Saunders, in which all illegal seizure of land or other offense against
the Colony of Connecticut was denied, and a counter charge was made; "but we
are very sensible of great wrongs that we have sustained by them for many
years." In 1671 the dispute grew so serious that Mr. Crandall, with others,
were actually carried off by the Connecticut authorities and was imprisoned at
Hartford. On May 2, of that year the Rhode Island assembly advised him not to
yield to Connecticut's claims and assured him of the Colony's support and that
his financial losses would be borne by the Colony.

The Reverend John Crandall was twice married. The name of his first wife is
unknown, but she died in 1670 and was buried on August 2 of that year. He
married, second, **Hannah Gaylord**.

The subjoining summary recorded events in the later life of John Crandall "of
Newport and Westerly, Rhode Island" is from <a href="#austin">Austin</a>'s
Authoritative Volumes *Genealogical Dictionary of Rhode Island*, and
*One Hundred and Sixty Allied Families of Rhode Island*.

John Crandall was early associated with the Baptists, at Newport, subsequently
becoming the first Elder of that denomination at Westerly.

  * ***1651, July 21***. He, with **John Clarke** and **Obediah Holmes**, "being the
representatives of the Church of Newport, upon the request of **William Witter**,
of Lynn, arrived there, he being a brother in the Church, who by reason of his
advanced age, could not undertake so great a journey as to visit the church.
**William Witter** lived about two miles out of Lynn and the next day being Sunday,
they spent in religious services at his house, and were there apprehended by
two constables at the instance of the Massachusetts authorities, while Mr.
Clarke was preaching, and the next morning they were sent to prison in Boston.
For the dire offense of holding this little meeting, and on other frivolous
pretexts **Obediah Holmes** was fined, imprisoned and whipped.

  * ***1651, July 31***. He was sentenced to pay a fine of L5 or be publically whipped.
He was released from prison upon his promise of appearing at next court.

  * ***1658; 59; 62; 63*** Commissioner.

  * ***1661, August 27***, he and eight others signed a letter of the Court of
Commissioners of Rhode Island, concerning a tract of land at Westerly, that
they and others desired approbation and assistance of Rhode Island in settling
upon.

  * ***1661, September 9***. He had half a share at Westerly assigned him.

  * ***1667***, Deputy.

  * ***1667, October 17***, Westerly. He was complained of in a letter from Connecticut
to Rhode Island authorities, for having come on west side of Pawcatuck River
and laid out about a mile square of land to his son.

  * ***1669, May 14***. He and **Joseph Torrey** were appointed Commissioners to treat with
Connecticut relative to jurisdiction of lands. The sum of 35 shillings was lent
to the Colony of Rhode Island by individuals for John Crandall's voyage to
Connecticut.

  * ***1669, May 18***. His name was on the List of Inhabitants. (Westerly)

  * ***1669, November 18***. A letter was sent him by Governor and Assistants, of
Connecticut, complaining that he and others had appropriated a great parcel of
Stonington township, and seeking for satisfaction.

  * ***1669, March 11***. He and **Tobias Saunders** answered on behalf of Westerly denying
any guilt in matter complained of, "but we are very sensible of great wrongs we
have sustained by them several years." The letter closes: "As for your advice
to agree with those, our neighbors of Stonington and the other gentlemen we
hope that your colony and ours, will in the first place lovingly agree, and
then we question not but that there will be an agreement between us and our
neighbors of Stonington, and the rest of the gentlemen."

  * ***1670, June 19***. He as Conservator of the Peace of Westerly, wrote a letter a
little prior to this date, to the Governor of Rhode Island, informing him "of
an entrance made into our jurisdiction by some of Connecticut, and of their
carrying away some inhabitants prisoners."

  * ***1670, August 2***. His first wife was buried.

  * ***1670, October 3***. He deeded eldest son, John of Newport, "for love &c.;, all my
good, chattels, debts, household utensils, and all other personal estate,
movable or immovable quick or dead putting him in quiet and peaceable
possession by payment of is in silver, by his son."

  * ***1670, 1671***. Deputy from Westerly.

  * ***1671, January 30***. Bills were allowed by Assembly, for hire of a boat to go to
Narragansett with **Mr. John Crandall Sr.** in the year 1670 and for hire of **Sarah
Reape**'s horse for use of Mr. John Crandall to go to Hartford.

  * ***1671, May 2***. He, having been "as is asserted" apprehended and now is in
durance, by the Colony of Connecticut and having desired the advice of the
Governor &c.; of Rhode Island whether to give bond or abide imprisonment, the
Colony will bear his charges and endeavor to justify his actings therein.

  * ***1671, may 6***. He was allowed 20 shillings, to bear his charge to Connecticut.

***1675, January 23***. In a letter from **Ruth Burdick**, to her father
**Samuel Hubbard**, of Newport, she says, *"Brother Crandall hath the ague and
fever still, and have been but little amongst us this winter, Sister Crandall
is brought to bed with a son, and is in a hopeful way."* (Ruth Burdick's
daughter Deborah (Samuel Hubbard's granddaughter) later married Elder John
Crandall's son (by his first wife) **Joseph Crandall**.


He died in Newport, having moved there on account of the Indian War.


  * ***1676, November 29***. Under this date **Samuel Hubbard**, writes from Newport
to **Mr. Edward Stennitt** in London, and after speaking of the devastation
caused by King Philip's War, he recounts the recent deaths in the First
Baptist Church: He says: *"of the old church, First **Mr. Joseph Torrey**, then
my dear brother **John Crandall**, then **Mr. John Clarke**, then **William
Weeden**, a deacon, then **John Salmon**; a sad stroke in very deed, young men
and maids to this day I never knew or heard the like in New England."*
Samuel Hubbard also wrote a few years later;
*“my dear brother **John Crandall** of Squamicut, is dead and his first wife a
Sabbath keeper, the first that died in that blessed faith in New England."*


His second wife was **Hannah Gaylord**, born 30 Jan. 1647, and probably was
daughter of **William and Ann (Porter) Gaylord**, of Windsor, Connecticut. The
said Hannah married a Crandall as is shown by the settlement of her brother
Hezekiah Gaylord's estate in 1677.


Home of John C. Crandall

**Elder John Crandall** died at Newport November 29, 1676, From the compiler the
following data of Elder John has been furnished: That he was born probably
Shropshire, England near the Welsh border. The western portion of this county
was formerly a part of Wales and later annexed to England. Hence the reason why
some authorities have made the assertion that Elder John Crandall was a
Welchman. One good authority states that he died 29 Nov. 1676 at the age of 67
yrs. which would indicate that he was born in 1609 and judging from the known
ages of some of his associates, this would seem probable. His first wife by
whom he had 7 children has not been positively identified but record shown that
she died 1 Aug. 1670. (Mildred Small of Etna, Pa. states she found in the
records in Washington, D.C. that the first wife of Elder John was **Mary Opp**
who died 20 Aug. 1669) Elder John married second, **Hannah Gaylord**, b. 30 Jan. 1647;
d. 3 Aug. 1678. After the death of Eld. John his widow married, second, **John
Cottrell, Jr.** Hannah Gaylord was the dau. of William (William, John Nicholas)
and Ann (Porter) Gaylord.

This is the old Crandall homestead mentioned in the deed. from the Harisons to
John Crandall 1864. He lived here for many years before the deed was finally
given. Located in Pierrepont, St. Lawrence Co., N.Y. Crandallville but later
changed to Howardville when the Howards were granted the Post Office. The
compiler and his father were both born here.


### Second Generation

#### 2. John Crandall
*Son of Eld. John, b. abt. 1649 in Newport, R.I.; d. 1704;
m. 18 June, 1672 in Warwick, R.I. by John Green, J.P., **Elizabeth Gorton**, dau. of **Samuel and Mary (Maplet) Gorton**.
(one record gives her as **Elizabeth (Burton) Gorton**).
(**Samuel Gorton** b. 1592; d. 1677; was in Boston 1836; Plymouth 1638; settled in Warwick, R.I. 1641).*

John called himself the son and heir of John Crandall of Newport, deceased. He
confirmed to his "beloved brothers Jeremiah and Eber, now resident of Newport,
and in tuition of their mother, Hannah Crandall, a certain house formerly the
Mansion House of my father John Crandall together with 200 acres thereto
belonging, lying and being in westerly."

12 Dec. 1682 he sold to George Lawton, Jr. of Freeman's Lands, New Plymouth,
certain land in Narragansett for 40s.

His will was dated 25 Jan. 1704, proved 14 Aug. 1704, made wife Elizabeth
exrx; named friend Job Babcock, brother Peter, and son in law Stephen Wilcox
overseers; gave to son John 5s he "having had already"; son Peter, wastermost
part of the farm I now dwell on; son Samuel rest of the land and housing; dau.
Elizabeth Wilcox 5s; dau. Mary Phillips 5a; wife Elizabeth all movables and
the whole use of all lands till sons Peter and Samuel were of age.

#### 3. James Crandall
*Son of Eld. John, b. 1651 probably in Newport, R.I.; took oath of allegiance
in Westerly 17 Sept. 1679; Freeman in Westerly 1681.*

(Howard Stillman Crandall of Westerly spent many years compiling the Crandall
records. He worked especially on the line of James and the following is taken
from his letter to Prof. Albert Rogers Crandall)

    James became dissatisfied with the settlement of his father's estate
    (leaving all to the eldest son which was the old English custom); left
    home when be became 21, going down the Pawcatuck River which runs into the
    ocean near the end of Fisher's Island and made his home almost opposite
    Watch Hill an Long Island where he married a girl whose sister had married
    a man by the name of **Raynor** who lived in Suffolk Co. on the seat end of
    Long Island. Because of his wife's religion, which was not of the Seventh
    Day Baptist faith, James was disowned by the rest or the family. James had
    quite a large family. His eldest son Samuel Nelson desiring a better
    education went to Manhattan. His father and the rest of his family removed
    to Cape May Co., N.J. where the exodus of whalers on Long Island had found
    new fields to explore. After receiving his education Samuel went to
    Duchess Co., N.Y. and probably had a large family.  Soon after, his two
    older brothers followed him. Samuel had sons Eber, Samuel and James and
    probably others as there are records or many Crandalls in this locality
    and Schaghticoks, Rensselaer Co., N.Y. and Cold Springs, Putnam Co., N.Y.
    which seems to point to the fact that they are the descendants of James.
    Being dissatisfied in Duchess Co. they after a time migrated to Rochester,
    N.Y. thence to Canada and finally some of them were in Ann Arbor, Michigan
    where we have Palmer Crandall and later Tanner Crandall. Many of these
    Canada Crandalls corresponded with Howard to establish their line with
    James. Also in the history of Tomkins and Tioga Counties, N.Y. is is an
    account of the line of a Henry Crandall son of Eber and Dinah (Vaughn), b.
    22 Sept. 1795 in Schaghticoks, Rensselaer Co., N.Y.; d. 9 Mar. 1882 in
    Millport, N.Y.; m. 19 Oct. 1816 in Smithville, N.Y.; Eliza, dau. of
    Charles Hill of Madison Co., N.Y. Eber Crandall was a native of Cold
    Spring, Duchess Co., N.Y. having been born there in 1755. His father
    having lived and died there. His father James was or English ancestry
    settling on Long Island before the dawn of the 17th century. Eber moved to
    Argyle, Washington Co., N.Y. when Henry was an infant and after other
    moves he finally came to Tomkins Co. where he died.

The history of Tomkins Co. establishes without doubt another line from James, son of Eld. John. While some positive connections are missing from dates and locations it is safe to assume that they are in the line of James and they will be found in a later section of the genealogy.

6. PETER CRANDALL of Westerly and Ashaway, R.I. son of Eld. John., was b. abt. 1655 in Westerly and died 1734. He married Mary Babcock, dau. of James Jr. and Jane ( -- ) Babcock. The records of this family are not clear. The data taken from Arnold's Vit. Records of R.I. contain a mistake, but just what it is and where it is seems impossible to determine at this date. From the records it would appear that Anna, who first married James Babcock, Jr. later married a Brown; that as the wife of James Babcock, she was the mother of Mary who married Peter Crandall and that as the wife of Mr. Brown, she was the mother of George Brown who married Charity, the dau. of Peter and Mary (Babcock) Crandall. Howard Crandall tried during his lifetime to straighten out the tangle with the result that he wrote: By the records Mary Babcock and George Brown, were half brother and sister; that Charity Crandall was the wife and also the niece of George Brown; that Peter Crandall was brother in law to his son in law George Brown; that Jane Brown was grandmother and mother in law or Charity (Crandall) Brown; that Jane Brown was, mother in law of Peter Crandall, which would make Mary Babcock, wife of Peter Crandall, his sister in law. This would also make Charity marrying her uncle, George Brown. Mr. Crandall finally gave up the problem and no one since his time has been able to solve it.

It would appear that George Brown and Charity (Crandall) Brown had the following children:

George.
Peter.

John.

Elizabeth.

Sarah.

Ruth.

William, who was left by will all his father's Cooper's tools.

Peter Crandall took the oath of allegiance in Westerly 17 May 1679; was a Freeman in 1681; deputy from 1699 1704; Justice of Peace and Lieut. of Militia and was an important man of his time.

Hubbard was dau. of Samuel, and Tacy Cooper Hubbard. Tacy (Tasy,Tase) Cooper came to Dorchester, Mass. 9 June 1634 from England and was married to Samuel Hubbard when she was 28 yrs. old. (Hist. of Windsor, Conn. from the Literary Diary of Ezra Stiles. Vol. 3 p. 28). Samuel Hubbard came to Salem, Mass. in 1633 and married Tacy Cooper 4 Jan. 1636 at Windsor, Conn. by Mr. Ludlow. They were both in the party that marched through the wilderness from Watertown, Mass. during the terrible winter of 1635 to become the founders of Conn. They were persecuted in Mass. for expressing their Baptist views. Samuel Hubbard finally in 1648 found refuge in R.I. where he was associated with Eld. John Crandall and others in founding the colony of R.I. which stands above all others for Its democratic principles.

Rev. Joseph Crandall was an ordained minister of the Seventh Day Baptist Church in Newport, R.I. 8 May 1715.

John called himself the son and heir of John Crandall of Newport, deceased. He confirmed to his "beloved brothers Jeremiah and Eber, now resident of Newport, and in tuition of their mother, Hannah Crandall, a certain house formerly the Mansion House of my father John Crandall together with 200 acres thereto belonging, lying and being in westerly."

3. JAMES CRANDALL, of Eld. John, 1651 probably in Newport, R.I.; took oath of allegiance in Westerly 17 Sept. 1679; Freeman in Westerly 1681.

(Howard Stillman Crandall of Westerly spent many years compiling the Crandall records. He worked especially on the line of James and the following is taken from his letter to Prof. Albert Rogers Crandall)

James became dissatisfied with the settlement of his father's estate (leaving all to the eldest son which was the old English custom); left home when be became 21, going down the Pawcatuck River which runs into the ocean near the end of Fisher's Island and made his home almost opposite Watch Hill an Long Island where he married a girl whose sister had married a man by the name of Raynor who lived in Suffolk Co. on the seat end of Long Island. Because of his wife's religion, which was not of the Seventh Day Baptist faith, James was disowned by the rest or the family. James had quite a large family. His eldest son Samuel Nelson desiring a better education went to Manhattan. His father and the rest of his family removed to Cape May Co., N.J. where the exodus of whalers on Long Island had found new fields to explore. After receiving his education Samuel went to Duchess Co., N.Y. and probably had a large family. Soon after, his two older brothers followed him. Samuel had sons Eber, Samuel and James and probably others as there are records or many Crandalls in this locality and Schaghticoks, Rensselaer Co., N.Y. and Cold Springs, Putnam Co., N.Y. which seems to point to the fact that they are the descendants of James. Being dissatisfied in Duchess Co. they after a time migrated to Rochester, N.Y. thence to Canada and finally some of them were in Ann Arbor, Michigan where we have Palmer Crandall and later Tanner Crandall. Many of these Canada Crandalls corresponded with Howard to establish their line with James. Also in the history of Tomkins and Tioga Counties, N.Y. is is an account of the line of a Henry Crandall son of Eber and Dinah (Vaughn), b. 22 Sept. 1795 in Schaghticoks, Rensselaer Co., N.Y.; d. 9 Mar. 1882 in Millport, N.Y.; m. 19 Oct. 1816 in Smithville, N.Y.; Eliza, dau. of Charles Hill of Madison Co., N.Y. Eber Crandall was a native of Cold Spring, Duchess Co., N.Y. having been born there in 1755. His father having lived and died there. His father James was or English ancestry settling on Long Island before the dawn of the 17th century. Eber moved to Argyle, Washington Co., N.Y. when Henry was an infant and after other moves he finally came to Tomkins Co. where he died.

The history of Tomkins Co. establishes without doubt another line from James, son of Eld. John. While some positive connections are missing from dates and locations it is safe to assume that they are in the line of James and they will be found in a later section of the genealogy.

6. PETER CRANDALL of Westerly and Ashaway, R.I. son of Eld. John., was b. abt. 1655 in Westerly and died 1734. He married Mary Babcock, dau. of James Jr. and Jane ( -- ) Babcock. The records of this family are not clear. The data taken from Arnold's Vit. Records of R.I. contain a mistake, but just what it is and where it is seems impossible to determine at this date. From the records it would appear that Anna, who first married James Babcock, Jr. later married a Brown; that as the wife of James Babcock, she was the mother of Mary who married Peter Crandall and that as the wife of Mr. Brown, she was the mother of George Brown who married Charity, the dau. of Peter and Mary (Babcock) Crandall. Howard Crandall tried during his lifetime to straighten out the tangle with the result that he wrote: By the records Mary Babcock and George Brown, were half brother and sister; that Charity Crandall was the wife and also the niece of George Brown; that Peter Crandall was brother in law to his son in law George Brown; that Jane Brown was grandmother and mother in law or Charity (Crandall) Brown; that Jane Brown was, mother in law of Peter Crandall, which would make Mary Babcock, wife of Peter Crandall, his sister in law. This would also make Charity marrying her uncle, George Brown. Mr. Crandall finally gave up the problem and no one since his time has been able to solve it.

It would appear that George Brown and Charity (Crandall) Brown had the following children:

George.
Peter.

John.

Elizabeth.

Sarah.

Ruth.

William, who was left by will all his father's Cooper's tools.

Peter Crandall took the oath of allegiance in Westerly 17 May 1679; was a Freeman in 1681; deputy from 1699 1704; Justice of Peace and Lieut. of Militia and was an important man of his time.

Hubbard was dau. of Samuel, and Tacy Cooper Hubbard. Tacy (Tasy,Tase) Cooper came to Dorchester, Mass. 9 June 1634 from England and was married to Samuel Hubbard when she was 28 yrs. old. (Hist. of Windsor, Conn. from the Literary Diary of Ezra Stiles. Vol. 3 p. 28). Samuel Hubbard came to Salem, Mass. in 1633 and married Tacy Cooper 4 Jan. 1636 at Windsor, Conn. by Mr. Ludlow. They were both in the party that marched through the wilderness from Watertown, Mass. during the terrible winter of 1635 to become the founders of Conn. They were persecuted in Mass. for expressing their Baptist views. Samuel Hubbard finally in 1648 found refuge in R.I. where he was associated with Eld. John Crandall and others in founding the colony of R.I. which stands above all others for Its democratic principles.
