# The Palatines' Story

[01](/assets/jones/the-palatines-story.01.jpg) The background of the great
"Palatine" emigration of 1709 has been well-chronicled by such past scholars
as Julius Goebel,. Sr., Friedrich Kapp, Sanford H. Cobb, F. R. Diffenderffer,
and Specially Dr. Walter A. Knittle. By mainly utilizing state papers and
official government records found in major repositories and libraries in
Europe and America, these noted historians did fine work and broke new ground
to give us "the big picture" of this great exodus of Germans to the new world. 

My own fifteen year Palatine project, howeyer, has approached this same
subject-matter from more of a genealogical rather than an historical point of
view (although, of course, both go hand in hand). I have studied the emigrants
themselves as much as the emigration, and thus have developed strong feelings
for the people involved as well as the events. The more I discover about the
Palatines from this personal perspective, the more my admiration and respect
for these courageous Germans grow, as I see how, after generations of
oppression and hardship, in 1709 they finally reached the limit of their
endurance and "took the risk" to find a better life in America. 

Excellent historical background material on the Palatines, largely unexplored
by previous researchers, has been found in the 17th and 18th century
churchbooks of the towns and villages where the emigrants resided. These old
registers are treasure-troves of data on the local level, for ever so often
the Pastors, after recording a baptism, marriage, or burial entry in their
church-books, would comment on important matters of the day affecting their
congregations. Their notations often were written with such poignancy that
they capture the spirit of the times and the flavor of life in the local
Palatine community better than any other sources I have seen. For example, the
churchbooks often reflect the devastation and havoc caused by the repetitive
wars fought, on German territory - a major factor leading to the 1709
emigration. The Pastor at Partenheim near Aizey wrote: 

    1635 after March: Shortly after this time, we were ruined and destroyed 
    throughout the land by the Swedish and Emperor's armies, so that we 
    could not come back again until the year 1637.

Some years later, the Pastor at **Westhofen** noted;

    1665: In the month of October, the by the Mainz-Lothringian invasion, 
    and the following children were baptised outside the area... 
    
    From October 1665 to 1669, this churchbook, along with my other best
    books, were taken to Worms for security... 

[02](/assets/jones/the-palatines-story.02.jpg) The plundering continued, as recorded by the as reported by the Pastor at **Kröffelbach**:

    On Friday 21 Dec 1688, a large French force came here to Cröffelbach, 
    plundered everything here and at Oberquembach, Oberwetz, Niederwetz,
    Reichskirchen [Reiskirchen] and other villages in the Wetterau,
    demanded a contribution, and left again for Cassel by Maintz [Castel near
    Mainz] and there crossed over the Rhine.  I took flight and, through God's
    help, escaped their hands.

One year later, the Pastor at **Ginsheim** echoed his colleague:

    Because-of the soldiers remaining se long in our land, with the French
    occupying the city of Mainz For two yrs., the German people have right to
    complain stout the [troop] movements back and forth in these parts: the
    Saxon and Bavarian armies are encamped in **Niederfeld** with 24,000 horse
    and foot [soldiers], the Hessians are on the other side of Mainz, and the
    Emperor's and [the] Lothringian troops are on the other side of tte Rhine
    below the city.

The churchbooks themselves sometimes did not survive, as noted by the Pastor at **Sprantal**:

    Because in 1693 with the french invasion of Wirtemberg every churchbock - as
    well as baptism and marriage record - met with misfortune, this new one has
    been set up by me, the duly called Pastor here, ant in it at the beginning is
    shown in orderly fashion all citizen/inhabitants with their families and the
    surviving wives and ch., at the time of their baptisms, marriages, and burials
    as later consecrated by me, so that each [subsequent] Pastor at the death of
    any one of these [inhabitants] can easily set out and record their life history
    without further research.

It is obvious from these contemporary, local accounts that 1709ers' families
had been living for generations in an area fraught with near-constant wars,
which made battlefields of villages, towns, and whole regions.

Besides being at the mercy of invading armies, many of these unfortunate
Germans were taxed unmercifully by whatever local Prince had jurisdiction over
their particular geographic region, and by 1709, many poor Palatines were bled
dry financiallY by their Lords. This was another reason for the exodus, as
evidenced by a portion of a letter written back to Germany in 1749 by
Johann Müller, an emigrant who finally settled in the Mohawk Valley of
Colonial new York: 

    Is it still as rough [in Germany] as when we left [in 1709]?  As far as we
    are concerned [in America], we are, Compared to taxes In Germany, a free
    country!  We pay taxers once a year.  These taxes are so minimal that some
    spend more money for drinks in one evening When going to the pub.  What the
    farmer farms is his own, there are no tithes, no tariffs, hunting and fishing 


[03](/assets/jones/the-palatines-story.03.jpg)

    are free, and our soil is fertile and everything grows...

But perhaps the straw that broke the camel's back was the devastating and
bitterly cold winter of the year 1709.  Throughout southern Germany, Pastors
abrubtly stopped their normal recording of baptismal, marriage, and burial
entries in order to mention the terrible weather conditions burdening their
congregations.  The Pastor at **Berstadt** wrote:

    [in the year 1709] there has been a horrible, terrible cold, the like of
    which is not remembered by the oldest [parishoners] who are upwards of 80
    years old.  As one reads in the newspapers, it spreads not only through
    the entire country, but also through France, Italy, Spain, England,
    Holland, Saxony, and Denmark, where many people and cattle have frozen to
    death.  The mills in almost all villages around here also are frozen in,
    so that people must suffer from hunger.  Most of the fruit trees are
    frozen too, as well as most of the grain...

The Pastor at **Runkel** noted:

    [1709] Right after the New Year, such a cold wave came that the oldest
    people here could not remember a worse one.  Almost all mills have been
    brought to a standstill, and the lack of bread was great everywhere.  Many
    cattle and humans, yes - even the birds and the wild animals in the woodsi
    froze. The Lahn [River] froze over three times, one after the other... 

At **Diedenbergen** another entry:

    [27 Oct 1708] Before Simon Juda [Day], an usually heavy snow fell which
    broke many branches off the trees, especially in the forests because the
    leaves were still on the trees, and the snow weighed heavily on them.  Then
    on the day after New Year's, 2 Jan 1709 and for three days [thereafterJ, we
    had continuous rain and later snow.  Because of the great cold, the Main
    froze over in four days, the Rhine in eight days, and they remained frozen
    for five weeks.  During this time there was a great lack of wood and flour,
    since most miliS were frozen in.  The fodder for cattle was used for two
    purposes [the humans had to eat it too], and many a piece [of land?] was
    ruined.  One could read in the newspapers of many complaints and much damage
    in all European countries. 

And at **Bolters**, even more:

    From the 6th to the 26th of January [1709] there was such a raging cold, the
    likes of which has not occurred in 118 yrs.  according to the calculations
    of the mathematicians at Leipzig.  A great many trees have frozen, the
    autumn sowing has suffered great damage, and this yr.  there will be no
    wine at all.

Residents of the various Duchies of southern Germany then were in a terrible
state from the ongoing wars, oppressive taxation, and devastating winter - all
of which contributed to their 

[04](/assets/jones/the-palatines-story.04.jpg) desire to emigrate from their
"forsaken Egypt," as Johann Müller of the Mohawk called his former European
homeland in his 1749 letter.

Interestingly enough, religious persecution does not seem to have been a major
factor in the exodus.  Many of the Palatines seemed quite flexible in their
religious affiliatton; they attended whichever church was geographically
convenient or even politically expedient.  For example, the 1709er
Johannes<sup>[\[1\]](NEEDLINK)</sup> Heiner was baptised a Catholic, married in the Reformed
church, then became a prominent Lutheran lay leader in the Hudson Valley.
Also, many emigrants who were noted in Germany and shortly after their arrival
in America as Catholics ("Episcopal" is Kocherthal's term for Catholic) soon
turned up as full-fledged Protestants in Lutheran and Reformed churchbooks of
colonial New York.  It is intereeting to note that **Neuwied** and
**Isenburg**, two of the prime German regions of origin for New York settlers,
both had atmospheres of religious toleration in the late 1500's - perhaps a
contributing factor to the later, theologically flexible viewpoint of many of
the 1709ers.

The British government exploited the Palatines' dissatisfaction by waging an
advanced and clever public relations campaign extolling the virtues of life in
the new world which also fueled the fires of emigration.  This was accomplished
by the circulation throughout southern Germany prior to 1709 of the so-called
"Golden Book," which painted America (called "The Island Of Carolina" or "The
Island Of Pennsylvania") almost as the promised land of milk and honey.  Its
effect is revealed by a marvelous series Of manuscripts entitled "Questions and
Answers Of Emigrants Who Intend To Go To The New Island, Actum 23 May 1709,"
found in the Staatsarchives Wiesbaden (Nassau-Weilburg File Abt. 150, No. 4493);
these documents are a boon for the genealogist, as they give the name, age,
religion, place of birth, length of marriage, and number of children among their
statistics for each prospective emigrant.  They also enhance our view of the
daily lives of the Palatines, as each man is asked several personal questions
relating to his reason for leaving as well as how he will finance his journey.
The heart-rending responses to the queries are set forth in such a
straight-forward, conversational way by the Palatines that they almost seem to
make the emigrants come alive again.  It is hard not to feel their despair and
not be moved by their cautious hope for a better lire in a new country.  When
asked how he first came upon the idea to emigrate and who first gave a reason
for the emigration, Christian Schneider aged 25, Lutheran, married 2 years with
no children stated: 

[05](/assets/jones/the-palatines-story.05.jpg)

    People from Altenkirchen. English agents at Frankfurt and writings brought
    by them.

Johannes Willig aged 32, Lutheran, born In this country (Nassau-Weilburg),
married 8 years with 1 daughter, replied:

    Because he's poor and has nothing more than he can earn by hard labour, he
    seeks something better. At Grossen Linden he had a book about the Island.

When he was asked the same question, Johannes Linck aged 10, Lutheran, born Cöpern
in Hamburg an der Höhe, married 6 years with 1 son and 1 daughter, answered:

    He cultivated in the winter and the grain was bad.  He knows he can no longer
    feed himself.  He had heard of books about the Island and resolved to go there.
    First heard of this froth people from Darmstadt who are going.

Hanß Georg Gäberling aged 40, Lutheran, came here from Lindheim an der Straße,
married 16 years with 3 daughters, responded:

    Poverty drives him to it, in spite of working day and night at his handwork.
    OtherWise he has no special desire to emigrate. He heard of books in Braunfels
    and at Altenkirchen which Schoolmaster Petri at Reiskirchen brought to the
    village on his deer-hunting.

Georg Philip Mück aged 32, Lutheran, born in this country, married 8 years with
1 son and 2 daughters, similarly replied:

    Poverty brought him to it.  He can hope for no harvest which the wild animals
    have eaten. There have been people from the Pfalz in the village, and he
    heard about it from them first. 

Johannes Flach aged 30, Catholic, came to Nassau-Wellburg, married 10 years
with 3 sons, noted:

    Poverty and no espeetation of [ever obtaining] land. Wild animals have eaten
    everything.  Has heard most about it at Frankfurt.  He and G. Stahl bought a
    book for 3 Batzen in which there is writing about the Island.

When asked another question, whether he received advice about this and from whom,
Philip Adam-Hartmann aged 31, Lutheran, born in this country, married 8 years
with 1 daughter, responded:

    No [advice]. Only from God, because people so advise it.

And to this same query, Phil1ps Petri aged 42, Lutheran, born in this cOUntry,
married 12 years, 2 sons and 7. daughters, answered:

    No one advised him, but people everywhere are talking about it!

Another question was asked as to what he actually knows about the so-called New
Island?  Christian Schneider replied:

    Nothing, except that it is undeveloped and could be built up with work. 

[06](/assets/jones/the-palatines-story.06.jpg) Johannes Willig added:

    The place is a better land, if one wants to work.

Philip Adam Hartmann responded to the same query:

    By work one could earn in one yr. enough to live on for two years.

Georg Philip Mück answered:

    The Queen of England will give bread to the people until they can produce
    their own.

And Valentin Nomsboth aged 37, Reformed, came from the Braunfels area, married
12 years with 2 sons, said:

    There is supposed to be a good land there, and, in a few years, one can get
    both bread and land.

The prospective emigrant was then asked who told him such and under what
circumstances?  Christian Schneider answered:

    From a book from English agents with a carpenter from Essershausen, but he
    hasn't read it.  The carpenter quoted from it to him.

The emigrant was then asked a final question.  From where does he think he will
get the means for this journey?  Johannes Willig said:

    He wants to sell what little he has.

Hanß Georg Gäberling noted:

    He wants to sell his livestock. 

Johann Philip Hetzel aged 36, Lutheran, married 16 years with 4 daughters and 2
sons, answered: 

    He wants to sell his few sheep.

Wentzel Dern aged 40, Lutheran, born in this country, married 14 years with 
3 sons and 4 daughters, answered:

    He wants to sell his cow, but leave his other possessions with friends.

Johann Wilhelm Klein aged 25, Lutheran, married since Christmas, gave an
important response: 

    The Queen will advance it to the people.

Johann Adam Fehd aged 30, Lutheran, born in this country, married With 1 son,
put his trust elsewhere:

    He must have God's help!

But perhaps the most important yet most intangible factor in the emigration was
the character and psychological make-up of 

[07](/assets/jones/the-palatines-story.07.jpg) the 1709ers themselves.  They
seemed to have within their souls Some special spark, some sense of daring and
adventure which enabled them to gamble their lives and families on an unknown
fate and set forth across a mighty ocean to a strange land.  Several emigrants
were noted in churchbooks prior to 1709 as "vagabondus" and thus were already
on the move.  Some exhibited a genuine landhunger and a desire to better their
lot even before leaving Germany, as exemplified by a few of the responses to
the Nassau-Weilburg questionaires.  And then there were those hearty souls who
found their way to colonial N.Y. who were simply dreamers, as shown by this
rather caustic comment of the Pastor of **Welterod**:

    [1709] In this year the winter was terrible cold and because of its fury the
    spring crops of nut, cherry, and apple trees are almost gone...
    
    A particularly deceptive spirit this year broke out among many people,
    especially those more or less lazy and indolent fellows who left their
    fatherland with wife and children to travel to England from where they
    were to be transported to Carolina in the West Indies or America, about
    which land they allowed themselves to dream again of great splendors where
    one should almost believe that breakfast bread would rain into their mouths.
    Moreover, they would not let themselves be deterred from their calm delusion
    through more accurate respresentation of the facts.  Out of my congregation
    here, for example, a single, miserably lazy fellow babbled about this with
    his wife and 3 children then left from here - namely Johann Curt Wüst from
    Strüth.  There were others there who came back again after repenting of
    their foolishness, but he is not found among them.

I say, "Thank God for the dreamers!"  One of the discoveries in my finding over
500 of the 847 New York Palatine families in their German homes is the fact that
so many emigrants originated in areas outside the boundaries of what we think of
today as the Palatinate.  Many New York settlers were found in the Neuwied,
Isenburg, Westerwald, Darmstadt, and Nassau regions as well as the Pfalz -
proving again that the term "Palatine" was more of a generic reference (meaning
"Germans" in general) rather than a literal description of their precise,
geographic origins.  The Pastor of **Dreieichenhain**, midway between Darmstadt
and Frankfurt, substantiates the widespread origins or the 1709ers in an utterly
fascinating entry in his churchbook:

    The year 1709 began with such severe and cold weather and lasted such a long
    time that even the oldest people could not remember ever having experienced
    such a winter; not only were many birds frozen and found dead, but also many
    domesticated livestock in their sheds.  Many trees froze, and the winter
    grain was also very frozen...
