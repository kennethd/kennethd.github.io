# Local DNS Cache with pdnsd


## installation

on debian, should be as simple as **aptitude install pdnsd**

your `/etc/resolv.conf` should contain only

  nameserver 127.0.0.1

debian installs pdnsd with a dedicated user account.  upstream packages
previously ran the daemon as `nobody`, but using such a common account
created a vulnerability as an exploitation of any other process running as
`nobody` could allow an attacker to poison your cache.

### dhclient



### resolvconf

If your system uses `resolvconf`, your `/etc/resolv.conf` will probably warn
you that any customizations to the file will be overwritten.  In that case you
need to update `/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base`


# Useful commands


## forget a cache entry

  $ sudo pdnsd-ctl record rt.ylayali.net delete

## blocking domains

### create a **neg** (negative cache record) in your config file

{% highlight shell-session %}
kenneth@dhalgren:~$ grep ^neg /etc/pdnsd.conf 
neg { name=doubleclick.net; types=domain; }
neg { name=clkads.com; types=domain; }
{% endhighlight %}

### forget any currently cached value as above & restart the service

{% highlight shell-session %}
kenneth@dhalgren:~$ sudo pdnsd-ctl dump clkads.com
Opening socket /var/cache/pdnsd/pdnsd.status
clkads.com.
    11/21 22:39:11    A       108.168.157.82

Succeeded

kenneth@dhalgren:~$ sudo pdnsd-ctl record clkads.com delete
Opening socket /var/cache/pdnsd/pdnsd.status
Succeeded
{% endhighlight %}

It may be worthwhile to check your current cache for any subdomains you also
want to delete

{% highlight shell-session %}
kenneth@dhalgren$ sudo pdnsd-ctl record ads.exoclick.com delete
kenneth@dhalgren$ sudo pdnsd-ctl record static.exoclick.com delete
kenneth@dhalgren$ sudo pdnsd-ctl record custom.exoclick.com delete
kenneth@dhalgren$ sudo pdnsd-ctl record syndication.exoclick.com delete
kenneth@dhalgren$ sudo pdnsd-ctl record main.exoclick.com delete
{% endhighlight %}

finally, restart pdnsd

{% highlight shell-session %}
kenneth@dhalgren:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/pdnsd stop 
Stopping pdnsd.

kenneth@dhalgren:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/pdnsd start
Starting pdnsd.
{% endhighlight %}

Handy one-liner for annoying domains that create hundreds of records
{% highlight shell-session %}
$ sudo pdnsd-ctl dump | grep olark.com | grep -v '^ ' | xargs -I '{}' sudo pdnsd-ctl record '{}' delete
{% endhighlight %}
