# Direct Lineage of KLD (5 gens)
![KLD direct lineage 5 gen](/assets/genealogy/kld-direct-lineage-5gen.jpg)

*The initials KLD works for myself, Kenneth Lee, as well as my sisters Kristine Lynn and Kim Lynette*


# Immigrants to America

Arrival dates are actual ships' arrival dates, if known, else the date and
place of the earliest documentary evidence of the person being in America


## Andrews



## Badcock, James; arr. Portsmouth, RI by 1641
*KLD's 9th great-grandfather via the [Babcock line](/genealogy/babcock/2019/04/08/babcock-research.html)*

Believed to be b. Essex, England in 1612; d. Stonington, CT, 12 Jun 1679.

Unknown arrival date, **Babcock Genealogy** has him first showing up at
Portsmouth, RI in 1642.  An ancestry.com collection *U.S. and International
Marriage Records, 1560-1900* lists James & Sarah Brown (below) as being married
there in 1641.  Multiple sources have their firstborn (also called James)
being born there in 1641.

**TODO:** There is a persistent rumor that he arrived aboard the *Anne*, but...
*I have to wait until I come across this argument again to finish this paragraph*


## Bassett, John; arr. New Haven, CT 1635
*KLD's 10th great-grandfather via the [Parker line](/genealogy/parker/2019/04/10/parker-research.html)*

*From FaG, unverified:*

John (b. 17 May 1589, Claybrooke Magna, Harborough district, Leicestershire, d. 15 Feb 1652).
Crossed with son, William (b. 1624 Surrey) *KLD's 9th great-grandfather*

*William Bassat was born in Dorking, Surrey and baptized 24 May 1624 to Roger
and Ann (Holland) Bassett.  He came in 1635 from London in the company of Rev.
Peter Hobart.  He removed to the colony of New Haven*

William Bassatt (1624-1684) m. Hannah Dickerman (1622-1657), and their
daughter Hannah Bassett (b. 1650 New Haven) m. John Parker (1648-1711)


## Beach, Thomas; arr. New Haven, CT 1638
*KLD's 9th great-grandfather via the [Parker line](/genealogy/parker/2019/04/10/parker-research.html)*

<a href="/genealogy/2019/04/22/genealogy-sources.html#virkus">Virkus</a> has him as arriving at New Haven, CT in 1638

Thomas was born at St. Albans, Devon, England in 1613, and died 1662 at Milford, CT.
his parents were Thomas & Joan Hill.  He married Sarah Platt (b. Tring,
England 1636; d. Milford, CT 1698), who also arrived at New Haven in 1638 with
her parents (see Platt, below).  Their son John Beach (b. Milford, CT, 19 Oct 1655)
married Mary Royce (b. Wallingford, CT, 1657), and they in turn had a daughter,
Hannah Beach (b. Wallingford, CT, 17 Mar 1683) who married Eliphalet Parker Sr. 


## Brown, Sarah; arr. Portsmouth, RI by 1641
*KLD's 9th great-grandmother via the [Babcock line](/genealogy/babcock/2019/04/08/babcock-research.html)*

Sarah Brown (b. Essex Co., England, 23 Jan 1613; d. Westerly, 22 Sep 1665)
married immigrant James Badcock (above) in Portsmouth, RI.

It is unclear whether James & Sarah made the crossing together, met on board,
or only met after arriving in the colonies.


## Burdick, Robert; arr. Newport, RI 1651
*KLD's 9th great-grandfather via the [Babcock line](/genealogy/babcock/2019/04/08/babcock-research.html)*

<a href="/genealogy/2019/04/22/genealogy-sources.html#colket">Colket</a> lists Robert Burdick as the Primary Immigrant arriving at Newport, 1651

Robert married Ruth Hubbard at Westerly, 2 Nov 1655, daughter of Samuel Hubbard (below),
among their 4 daughters was Deborah Burdick (b. Westerly, 1 Jan 1662; d.
Westerly, 12 Dec 1697), who married Joseph Crandall.  Joseph & Deborah gave
birth to Lydia Crandall in 1683, who marr. Robert Babcock (b. Westerly 1678;
d. Westerly 1719) in 1701.  Robert Babcock being the grandson of immigrant
James Badcock (b. 1612), listed above.

## Crandall, John; arr. Newport, RI 1651
*KLD's 9th great-grandfather via the [Babcock line](/genealogy/babcock/2019/04/08/babcock-research.html)*

    born in Monmouthshire, England, on the line between England and Wales in 1612

    He came to Boston within a very few years after the landing of the
    Pilgrims, in 1634.  Several writers have ascertained that he was
    associated with the Congregational Church at Salem as 1635 and that “he
    was certainly living in Providence as early as 1637” and while there are
    many reasons for believing these statements correct and that John Crandall
    was a close associate of Roger Williams was one of the founders of
    Providence, unfortunately it seems impossible certainly to confirm them.
    Many of the original Providence records were early destroyed.

    The first valid documentary account of John Crandall in New England shows
    him to have been actively identified with the Baptist Church in Newport,
    July 21, 1651.  His name next is found, with that of Matthew West in the
    Freemen’s list of Newport, 1655.

Pewowar (b. Poland 10 Oct 1877) both arriving in the US in 1893 (17 years
prior), but only having been married for 13 years.  In the 13 years, they had
had 10 children, of which 5 were alive, the oldest of them being Stanley (6 yrs)

## Gérard, Nicolas; arr. 1829
*KLD's 3rd great-grandparents via the [Babcock line](/genealogy/babcock/2019/04/08/babcock-research.html)*

Nicolas Gérard (b. Lure, Haute-Saône, France, 14 Feb 1800; d. Salt Creek, OH 27 May 1879), 
married Frances Lignon (b. Nancy, Alsace-Lorraine, France, 30 Aug 1807; d.  Kansas City, 1888)

## Giddings, George; arr. Ipswitch, MA, 1635
*KLD's 9th great-grandfather via the [Parker line](/genealogy/parker/2019/04/10/parker-research.html)*

George Giddings (b. 24 Sep 1609; d. 1 Jun 1676) was the son of John Giddings
of Clapham in Bedfordshire and Joan Purrier.  He and Jane Lawrence (b. 1614)
made the crossing together aboard the **Planter**, both registered with the
surname Giddings, but there is evidence they married upon arrival, in
Ipswitch, MA 1635, their marriage license dated 20 Feb 1634, suggesting they
may not have been able to be married by their preferred church in England.

Their son & second born, John (b. Ipswitch 1639; d. Ipswitch 3 Mar 1691) married 
Sarah Alcock *(8th GGP)*.  John & Sarah gave birth to Thomas Giddings (b.

Joshua's daughter Ruth Giddings (b. Hartland, CT, 1750) marr. Eliphalet Parker III


## Harkness, Adam; emig. Ire; arr. Boston, MA, 1730

being in Boston by 1730 and settling at Smithfield, RI by about 1740.

Adam's father John seems to have been born in Belfast, 1675, and dies at
Dumfries, Scotland either on 7 Aug 1734, or sometime in the early 1730s.
<a href="/genealogy/2019/04/22/genealogy-sources.html#dobson">Dobson</a> mentions a John Harkness arriving in America in 1684,
though there is no reason to assume it is the same John.

*KLD's 1st cousin, 5 x removed*

2nd PA Cavalry, 59th Regiment

Enlisted into the Pennsylvania Volunteers 2nd Cavalry, Company I
(aka 59th Regiment) on 20 Aug 1864 in Meadville, PA for one year of service,
rank of Private.  In August or September of 1864 he was transferred to Company E,
where he remained on muster rolls until December 1864, at which time he was
sent to City Point Hospital due to becoming ill & partially deranged.
He died in service: 14 or 16 December 1864 at City Point Hospital, VA, and was
buried in City Point National Cemetery, Hopewell, VA.
Pension No. 131798 – Filed on 18 February 1865 by widow.

*The exact cause of his death is unclear. One account has him sick in the
hospital, becoming deranged, leaving the hospital, & was shortly after found
dead in a box, having been shot in a fit of rage.  Another account has him
becoming deranged & sent to the hospital, where he escaped & returned to his
unit.  The illness worsened & he was placed in the guardhouse with deserters &
rebel prisoners, where he was reported dead on 16 December 1864.  The Adjutant
General statement has him dying at City Point Hospital of Bronchitis on 14
December 1864.  Yet another statement has him shot in the line of duty & dying
of wounds.  Witnesses describe him as being nervous & easily excited during his
illness.  His regiment was reportedly out on duty in the cold rain for several
days, after which he & several others fell ill.  I believe him to have fallen
ill to Typhoid Fever, an illness which causes delirium & hyperactivity, thus
giving it the nickname “Nervous Fever”.  This would explain his derangement &
being easily excited during his illness.  More than 80,000 Union soldiers died
of Typhoid & Dysentery during the Civil War.  All accounts of Ledyard agree on
the fact that he was a good & faithful soldier & that the illness he suffered
caused his derangement & excitability.*
