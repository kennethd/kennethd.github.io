#### Parker, George Edward (b. Warsaw, NY, Dec. 1842; d. Menasha, WI bef. 1910)

#### Parker, Ledyard (b. Warsaw, NY, 1820; d. Petersburg, VA, 14 Dec, 1864) *2nd PA Cavalry, 59th Regiment*
*KLD's 1st cousin, 5 x removed*

Enlisted into the Pennsylvania Volunteers 2nd Cavalry, Company I
(aka 59th Regiment) on 20 Aug 1864 in Meadville, PA for one year of service,
rank of Private.  In August or September of 1864 he was transferred to Company E,
where he remained on muster rolls until December 1864, at which time he was
sent to City Point Hospital due to becoming ill & partially deranged.
He died in service: 14 or 16 December 1864 at City Point Hospital, VA, and was
buried in City Point National Cemetery, Hopewell, VA.
Pension No. 131798 – Filed on 18 February 1865 by widow.

*The exact cause of his death is unclear. One account has him sick in the
hospital, becoming deranged, leaving the hospital, & was shortly after found
dead in a box, having been shot in a fit of rage.  Another account has him
becoming deranged & sent to the hospital, where he escaped & returned to his
unit.  The illness worsened & he was placed in the guardhouse with deserters &
rebel prisoners, where he was reported dead on 16 December 1864.  The Adjutant
General statement has him dying at City Point Hospital of Bronchitis on 14
December 1864.  Yet another statement has him shot in the line of duty & dying
of wounds.  Witnesses describe him as being nervous & easily excited during his
illness.  His regiment was reportedly out on duty in the cold rain for several
days, after which he & several others fell ill.  I believe him to have fallen
ill to Typhoid Fever, an illness which causes delirium & hyperactivity, thus
giving it the nickname “Nervous Fever”.  This would explain his derangement &
being easily excited during his illness.  More than 80,000 Union soldiers died
of Typhoid & Dysentery during the Civil War.  All accounts of Ledyard agree on
the fact that he was a good & faithful soldier & that the illness he suffered
caused his derangement & excitability.*

Wilderness, Spotsylvania, North Auna, Cold Harbor, and was in the actions in
the vicinity of Petersburg, which resulted in the fall of that city, and was
in the fight at Sailor's Creek.  At Chancellorsville he received a bullet in
his left hand, and was sent from the field hospital to Washington, and thence
to Wilmington, Delaware, where he remained until 29 Aug 1863.  Through the
campaign of the Army of the Potomac of 1864-65, he was in every battle in
