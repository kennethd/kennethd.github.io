## Arnold's Vital Record of Rhode Island

There are 21 volumes to James Newell Arnold's *Vital Record of Rhode Island*,
unfortunately I don't think there is a single index that spans the entire
work, but you can search the **creator:** field @ 
<a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Arnold%2C+James+N.+%28James+Newell%29%2C+1844-1927%22">archive.org</a>
to see the list of available volumes


## Colonial Period Dates

The following summarized from the <a target="_blank"

State Library, History & Genealogy Reference</a>

The 1752 Calendar Change

The Julian Calendar

The Gregorian Calendar

Interpreting Records



## Changing Place Names and Political Borders

I will try to keep references to places contempraneous with the subject, so
for example, you will not see references to the Unites States of America
before July 4, 1776.
