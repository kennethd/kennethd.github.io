# Babcock Arrival in America


# The Founding of Westerly

Family lore has it that [John Babcock](#babcock-john) *(KLD's 8th great-grandfather)*
came from Plymouth, Mass to Aquidneck and engaged to labor for Thomas Lawton
in Newport.  John eloped with Mr. Lawton's daughter Mary to Misquamicut, where
they became the first white settlers.

Note that the county of Westerly changed over the years: Kings County was
created in 1729 within the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations; it
was renamed Washington County on October 29, 1781 in honor of George Washington.


# The Murder of Robert Babcock
*Robert Babcock was KLD's 7th great-grandfather*

Robert Babcock (b. Westerly, RI, 1678; d. Westerly, RI, 27 Aug 1719) was
murdered by John Ross (b. 1690) of Westerly, son of William Ross (b. 1660)
and Hannah Hungerford, who then fled the town for Newport.

Robert lived a day or two, and wrote his will while lying wounded on his deathbed.

The day following his death, Justice Joseph Stanton wrote Governor Cransten to
secure John Ross at Newport.

Summarized from [stantonsociety.org](http://stantonsociety.org/Second%20Site/p8.htm):

    Joseph Stanton, Jr. was born in 1673 or 1674 at Rhode Island, son of Joseph
    Stanton and Hannah Mead.  Joseph married Esther Gallup, daughter of Benjamin
    Gallup and Esther Prentice, in 1673.  He died 2 Aug 1752 (or 1751).  He served
    as Assistant Magistrate in New London, and was a Justice in Westerly.

In 1891 the following letter was in the possession of Dr. George D. Stanton of
Stonington, CT.  It was addressed to Governor Samuel Cranston of Newport:
